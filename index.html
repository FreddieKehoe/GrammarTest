<p>Welcome to Freddie's guide to grammar. Here you will find info on Run-on Sentences, Homophones, Parts of Speech, and Roman Numerals. Not everything is 100% grammar related but whatever. I might add stuff but tbh nah. I only made this to fill up space on this website and because I was bored RIP me.<a name="Run-on Sentences"></a>
<hr />
<h2>Run-on Sentences</h2>
<p>A run-on sentence is when you combine two or more clauses and put them all into one sentence without the proper use of semicolons or commas. Note: You can combine multiple clauses and not have a run-on.</p>
<hr/>

<strong>Clauses</strong><br />
 A clause a full idea. Every clause has two parts, the subject and the predicate. The subject is whom or what the subject is about, and the predicate tells us something about the subject. For instance in the sentence, "I took my dog for a walk", "I" would be the subject, and "took my dog for a walk" would be the predicate. A clause makes up one complete sentence.
 <br />
 <br />
<strong>How do I fix my run-on sentence?</strong><br />
Separate the clauses with a period. The sentence "I ate cereal this morning I was very hungry" is an example of a run on sentence. To separate the two clauses you would put a period between "morning" and "I". This would now look like "I ate cereal this morning. I was very hungry".
<p>Separate the clauses with a semi-colon. The sentence "I am going to the bar after work today the bartender there is very nice" is a run-on sentence. To fix this with a semi-colon you would put it in-between "today" and "the". The sentence now looks like "I am going to the bar after work today; the bartender there is very nice." This is the same as using a period, however it should only be used if the two clauses are related to each other.</p>
<p>Comma - Conjunction. If you put a comma in-between both clauses with nothing else this is called a comma splice! In order to fix this you either remove the comma and put a period or semi-colon, or you put a conjunction after the comma. There are seven conjunctions: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. This is abbreviated into the acronym FANBOYS, (not the BadBoyHalo kind). Along with the FANBOYS conjunctions, however can also be used in this context. An example would be "Johnathan plays football he is very good at it". This alone is a run-on, however when I insert a comma-and into the middle it turns into a complete sentence. "Johnathan plays football, and he is very good at it."</p>
<a name="Homophones"></a>
<hr />
<h2>Homophones</h2>
Homophones are separate words that sound alike but are spelled differently.A homophone is a word that sounds the same as another word but has a different meaning and/or spelling. I will just include a few of the commonly mistaken homophones bellow.
<hr />
Your and You're<br />
 <ul><li> Your: possessive. When using the word "Your" we refer to something that belongs to someone in the second person. For instance "I like your jacket" or "that is not his car; that is your car!" We only use "your" in this sense.</li><li>You're: abbreviation of "you are". For instance "You're going to the bank" or "You're awfully cute today!" We never use "you're" when talking about possession.</li></ul>
There, Their, and They're<br />
 <ul><li>There: used to talk about a place, or attracting attention. "Hey there" is one example of attracting attention, and "look at that rock over there" is an example of location.</li>
 <li>Their: possessive, and only possessive. "That is not your house, that is their house!" is an example of the only way to use their. If you use their when talking about a place, it is incorrect! Don't do this!</li>
 <li>They're: abbreviation of "they are". You should only use this when you would normally say "they are". For instance "They're very nice people", or "They're the owners of this house!". Do not use this any other way than "they are".</li></ul>

To, Too, and Two<br />
 <ul><li>To: destination. This can either be the destination of an action, or geographic destination. "I am going to the Caribbean" and "I said that to Max" are both good examples.</li>
  <li>Too: also, too much. Too can be used to say there are too many of something, or it can be used in agreement to. "I like that movie too" and "I am too full for desert" are both correct uses. A lot of people on the internet mess this up, don't be one of them.</li>
 <li>Two: The number 2 typed out. Nuff said.</li></ul>
Affect/Effect<br />
 <ul><li>Affect: influence. The affect is the influence X had on Y. Tracy staying up late affected her poorly.</li>
 <li>Effect: Used as a noun. The magician had cool *effects* at the show.</list></ul>
Which/Witch<br />
 <ul><li>Which: Pronoun referring to to things or animals. I love my stuffed bear <em>which</em> I bought for myself!</li>
 <li>Witch: Throws potions of poison and damage at you.</li></ul>
Its/It's<br />
 <ul><li>It's: It is</li>
 <li>Its: Possessive</li></ul>
a lot/allot<br />
 <ul><li>allot: verb. I allotted you that land.</li>
 <li>a lot: very many.</li></ul>
 <a name="Parts of Speech"></a>
<hr />
<h2>Parts of Speech</h2>
A category to which a word is assigned in accordance with its syntactic functions. In English the main parts of speech are noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, articles and interjection.
<hr />
Noun<br />
<ul><li>A person, place, thing, or idea.</li></ul>

Pronoun<br />
<ul><li>Pronouns are used in place of nouns. He, she, it, we, y'all, and they are all pronouns.</li></ul>

Adjective<br />
<ul><li>An Adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun. For instance in "hairy cat", "hairy" is describing cat.</li>
<li>Article
 <ul><li>There are two articles, a and the. Articles are a type of Adjective</li></ul></ul>
Verb<br />
<ul><li>A verb is an action word. In the sentence "I rode the bus", rode is the verb.</li></ul>
Adverb<br />
<ul><li>An adverb describes a verb or adjective. In the sentence "You are super good at hitting baseballs", super is an adverb because it modifies good, which is an adjective. In the sentence "I am going to swing the bat so fast", fast is an adverb because it modifies swing. How are you swinging? Fast.</li></ul>

Preposition<br />
<ul><li>a word governing, and usually preceding, a noun or pronoun and expressing a relation to another word or element in the clause. This can be thought of as "how can a frog be in relation to a log?" The frog could be on, under, inside, next to, near, etc. to the log.</li></ul>

Conjunction<br />
<ul><li>A conjunction links together two clauses as described in the run-on section. Remember the FANBOYS conjunctions.</li></ul>

Interjection<br />
<ul><li>An interjection is a statement like "Damn!" "Golly Me!" "Tarnation!" or other things like that. These are normally fragment sentences.</li></ul>
<a name="Roman Numerals"></a>
<hr />
<h2>Roman Numerals</h2>
Well this isn't really grammar but I thought I'd throw it in. This also probably has some errors as I did most of this based off of research done <a href="https://www.math.nmsu.edu/~pmorandi/math111f01/RomanNumerals.html" target="_blank">here</a>. If you do not already know, Roman Numerals are the way that numbers were written in ancient Rome. The numerals go like this: I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), M (1000). These are all the stand-alone numbers. You can add these together in oder to make numbers. The rules are as follows:
<hr />
<ul><li>You can repeat numbers up to three times in a row to add them. For instance III = 3, however in order to get 4 you can not do IIII.</li><br />

<li>Writing numerals that decrease from left to right makes then add up. So MDCLXVI would be 1666, (1000 + 500 + 100 + 50 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 1666).</li><br />

<li>To write a number that otherwise would take repeating of a numeral four or more times, there is a subtraction rule. Writing a smaller numeral to the left of a larger numeral represents subtraction. For example, IV represents 5 - 1 = 4 and IX represents 10 - 1 = 9. To avoid ambiguity, the only pairs of numerals that use this subtraction rule are IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM.</li><br />

<li>To make larger numbers you can write a line above the numeral to multiply it by 1000. You can write as many lines as you want.</li></ul>

Examples:
 <ul><li>47: XLVII</li>
 <li>123: CXIII</li>
 <li>1998: MCMXCVIII</li>
 <li>2345: MMCCCVXL</li></ul>
